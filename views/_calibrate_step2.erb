<h2>Teapot Calibration Wizard - Step 2</h2>

<p>
  Thanks for that! It seems your empty teapot weighs <%= @data[:calib_empty_weight] %>
  grams (or something).
</p>

<p>
  Next, it might be nice to see if we can tell people roughly how many cups
  are left in the pot. So go and grab an ordinarily-sized cup full of water,
  pour that into the pot, pop the lid back on and click 'Continue'.
